# Snake Tutorial

GitHub repository to support [this guide on how I built it](https://ghoulkingr.hashnode.dev/building-a-snake-game-in-python-with-pygame). Here's an animation of the game:

Software versions:
* Python: 3.12.3
* PyGame: 2.6.0

# Playing on Your System

Since this isn't a binary file, you need to have Python version 3.12 installed. Any Python on version 3 will most likely work but this is
the version I used.

To play it on your system, you first need to clone this repository to your system.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhoulKingR/snake-tutorial.git
```

Then, could you set up a virtual environment if you'd like to?

After that, install the PyGame library into your Python environment:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
